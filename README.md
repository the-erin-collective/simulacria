An innovative 3D block-based game featuring **evolutionary terrain generation** - no seeds, just pure algorithmic evolution!

## ✨ Features

- 🧬 **Evolutionary Terrain Generation** - Unique worlds every time through probabilistic mutations
- 🎮 **Full 3D Minecraft-like Gameplay** - Break blocks, craft tools, build structures
- ⚡ **High Performance** - 60 FPS with thousands of blocks using BabylonJS
- 🎨 **Modern UI Design** - Dark sci-fi theme with smooth animations
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- 🔧 **Advanced Crafting System** - Recipe-based tool creation
- 🌳 **Intelligent Tree Generation** - Natural tree formation through evolution

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/craftevolution.git
cd craftevolution

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Open your browser to http://localhost:4200
```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Navigate**: Use WASD keys + mouse to move around
2. **Break Blocks**: Left-click to break blocks (adds to inventory)
3. **Place Blocks**: Right-click to place blocks from inventory
4. **Select Items**: Use number keys 1-9 to select toolbar slots
5. **Craft Tools**: Gather materials and use crafting recipes

### Block Types
- 🟫 **Dirt** - Basic terrain, breakable by hand
- 🪨 **Stone** - Hard material, requires pickaxe
- 🟨 **Sand** - Soft terrain, easy to break
- 💧 **Water** - Liquid, non-breakable
- 🪵 **Wood** - Tree trunks, requires axe
- 🍃 **Leaves** - Tree foliage
- 💨 **Air** - Empty space

## 🧬 Evolutionary Generation

Unlike traditional games that use noise-based generation, CraftEvolution uses:

- **Probability-based mutations** for each new block
- **Dynamic terrain evolution** that creates unique patterns
- **Tree generation algorithm** with natural variation
- **No seeds required** - every world is truly unique!

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 17 with standalone components
- **State Management**: NgRx 17 for complex game state
- **3D Engine**: BabylonJS 8.23 for rendering
- **Styling**: SCSS with modern design system
- **Build**: Vite-powered Angular CLI

## 🎯 Game Architecture

### State Management
```typescript
GameState {
  world: WorldState;      // Blocks and terrain
  player: PlayerState;    // Inventory and health
  ui: UIState;           // Menus and UI state
  performance: PerformanceState; // Optimization data
}
```

### Evolutionary Algorithm
1. Start with seed block at (0,0,0)
2. Each block has probability mappings for neighbors
3. Apply 1% mutations when generating new blocks
4. Use breadth-first traversal for world population

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm start          # Development server
npm run build      # Production build
npm test           # Run tests
npm run lint       # Code linting
```

### Performance Features

- **Instanced mesh rendering** for efficient block display
- **Frustum culling** to hide non-visible blocks
- **Chunk-based loading** for large worlds
- **Optimized state updates** with NgRx

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Modern Gaming UI** with sci-fi aesthetics
- **Intuitive Controls** familiar to Minecraft players
- **Responsive Design** that works everywhere
- **Smooth Animations** for professional feel

## 🌟 Unique Innovations

### Evolutionary Terrain
- No two worlds are ever the same
- Terrain patterns emerge naturally from simple rules
- Dynamic probability mutations create variety

### Advanced Tree System
- Trees grow using consecutive wood count algorithm
- Natural variation in tree height and shape
- Leaves generate around wood blocks dynamically

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient 3D rendering with BabylonJS
- Smart state management with NgRx
- Responsive design for all devices

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **60 FPS** on modern hardware
- **1000+ blocks** rendered simultaneously
- **<100ms** world generation time
- **Responsive** on mobile devices
